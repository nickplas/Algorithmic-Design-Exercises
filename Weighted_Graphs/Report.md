# Homework: Weighted Graps
### Plasencia Palacios Milton Nicol√°s

#### Exercise 1
The array-based inmplementation for Dijkstra's algorithm is found in the "graph.c" file in the "src" folder (name of function: 'dijkstra_queue').
I've implemented the suggested functions in the pdf "08_weighted_graphs", apart from the function "find_nodes" which is used to find the "neighbour" of a given node by searching for them in the adjacency matrix.

#### Exercise 2
The heap-based implementation for Dijkstra's algorithm is found in the "graph.c" file in the "src" folder (name of function: 'dijkstra_heap'). Here the implementation of that function is almost the same of the queue version, except from the fact that here we are using a Min-Heap. Due to some unexpected errors I've used a not-conventional way to get the root of the heap but it works and I obtain the same results as the queue implementation.

#### Exercise 3

Here I've tested my implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm on queues and on heaps. We can see that from <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=2^15"> heap version outperform the queue one and that can be explained using the asymptotic complexity of both implementations:

Queue Dijkstra: <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\Theta(|V|^2 \+ |E|)">

Heap Dijkstra: <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\Theta((|V| \+ |E|)\*\log (|V|))">

in which this difference in complexity is due to the different implementation of the functions "Build_queue", "Extract_min" and "Update_distance", that depends on the data struucture used.

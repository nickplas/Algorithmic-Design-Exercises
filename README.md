# Algorithmic-Design-Exercises
Exercises of the course "Algorithmic Design" held by prof. Casagrande. 

Inside every folder there's a "CMakeLists.txt" file so you'll need only to write:

```
cmake CMakeLists.txt
make
```

to obtain the desired executables. The reports are the pdf files inside every directory, except from the ones in "Strassen_Algorithm" and "Weighted_Graphs", those are ".md" files.
